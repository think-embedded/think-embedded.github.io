Hi, I'm a passionate **Embedded Software Engineer**, with exprience across various domains, including **military devices**, **automotive systems**, **IoT devices**, **camera**. My interest spans **Linux systems**, **AOSP**, **real-time operating systems (RTOS)**, **Computer Architecture**, **Operating System** and a love for low-level programming with **C/C++**. While I'm always pushing the boundaries of tech development, I'm also delving into areas like **Python** and **IoT** for innovative solutions in embedded systems.

Outside of the world of tech, I enjoy staying active with sports like **soccer**, **badminton**, and **table tennis**, while also taking time for **meditation** and exploring topics related to **awareness** and **mindfulness**. These interests help me maintain balance and focus in both my professional and personal life.

Through this blog, I’ll share not just my technical experiences but also my thoughts on personal growth and self-awareness. I hope you’ll join me on this journey as we explore the intersections of **technology**, **mindfulness**, and **creativity**. Thanks for stopping by!
